#live accident is taking place between 2 cars npc1 and npc2, ego stops for the victimâ€™s aid
# npc3 is moving in the rightmost lane when it suddenly changes lane to the left.
# it forces npc1 to slow down immediately.
# npc2 which is right behind npc1 is not attentive and is unable to slow down. Hence an accident occurs.
#ego stops to help the injured people.
