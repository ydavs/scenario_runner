#scenario to implement ego vehicle overtaking


#Ego vehicle is overtaking a vehicle who is also overtaking another vehicle
#npc2 is to simulate traffic
#npc3 is a temp car just to access lane 3

    path.set_map("Highway_Map_Light")    # specify map to use
    path.path_min_driving_lanes(3)         # Path should have at least 3 lanes
